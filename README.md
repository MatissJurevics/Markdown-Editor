This is a simple markdown editor Built with svelte that allows you to create documents using mardown. This allows you to type anything into the imput field and it will return a formatted markdown document

**The libraries it is using right now are as follows:**
- uuid (providing each post with an id)
- marked 
- marked-images
- tailwindcss
- tailwind/typography
- iconify/svelte

### Roadmap:
- Download and upload files
- Save to blogs api
- change between markdown and html for styling
- Fix images (limit size and center them)
