This is a part of my blog that is a current WIP. I wanted to start with this as it would help me understand how to deal with markdown a bit better. It was made with svelte and I used tailwind for styling.

**The libraries it is using right now are as follows:**
- uuid (providing each post with an id)
- marked 
- marked-images
- tailwindcss
- tailwind/typography
- iconify/svelte

### Roadmap:
- Download and upload as JSON
- Save to blogs api
- change between markdown and html for styling
- Fix images (limit size and center them)
